# Rock Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock. A classic game with a twist!

This game is made for those who doesn't have someone to play rock, paper, scissor, liard, spock with. Here you can play the game as much as you want. It's easy to use and is enjoyable for all ages.

You play against the computer, who picks a random option everytime.

### Features Left to Implement

- A feature that could be added in the future is to track the score, set a score limit and reset score button. 

## Testing

I have played this game with multiple options to see if it works as intended. From my testing I haven't stumbled upon any problems with the game. It the computer picks a random option everytime and follows the rules on who won and lost.

The game works on different platforms and is adaptive and responsive.

I did not encounter any bugs. But I did have to try different options to make the game work with the addition of lizard and spock since the game was based on rock, paper and scissor.
